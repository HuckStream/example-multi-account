# Contents of aws/net ESC environment
#
# Configure an AWS OIDC connection for use with an explicit provider
# Key points:
#   - AWS OIDC provider configured as per normal documention
#     See: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/oidc/provider/aws/
#   - Name of login element is `aws-net`, not `aws`, preventing conflict and
#     override during import or composition
#   - No environment variables are set, as they would conflict with and override those of
#     the default provider depending on import order
#   - Cricical authentication values are passed into the Pulumi config, using
#     the key names required by the aws.Provider constructor
#     See: https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/provider/#inputs
